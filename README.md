Restaurant Reservation System with Rewards

This project is a customized reservation system created specifically for my restaurant. Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, the system not only makes it easy for customers to make online reservations quickly and efficiently but also enhances the customer experience with an integrated rewards system and an interactive daily menu.

Main Features

Quick and Effective Reservations: Customers can easily make reservations, enjoying a user-friendly interface and a streamlined reservation process.
Loyalty Points System: For every reservation made, customers accumulate points. Upon reaching 100 points, they are generated a QR code with a discount that can be redeemed at the restaurant.
Viewing Accumulated Points: Customers can check the points they have accumulated at any time directly through the system.
Interactive Daily Menu: In addition to making reservations, customers can view the updated daily menu, allowing them to plan their visit according to the available culinary options.
Customizable Backend: From the backend, it's possible to manage the restaurant's opening days, schedule vacation days, change the daily menu, analyze user points, and view all reservations.
System Usage

Online Reservations: Customers visit the restaurant's website and complete the reservation process.
Points Accumulation: For each reservation, points are automatically accumulated in the account associated with the customer's email.
Rewards Redemption: Upon reaching 100 points, customers receive a special discount through a QR code.
Consulting the Daily Menu: Customers can view the daily menu before their visit to know the available options.
Development and Customization

The system has been developed in German, with comments and descriptions in the code in Spanish, reflecting my personal approach and the identity of my restaurant. It is designed to be intuitive for both customers and the restaurant administration.
